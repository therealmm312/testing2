    <h2>HELLO! This was a classic Megan ploy!</h2>
    <h3>Well, not really- you must have known exactly what was coming this time.</h3>

    <h3>So.. am I embarrassed right now? Nope, I did this last year.</h3>

    <p>
      <br>
      I know Valentine's Day is a big old capitalistic scam, but I love you and want to do something cute.
      <br><br>
      So, I would like to take this opportunity, through this fake website to ask you if you'd like to be my Valentine?
      <br><br>
      I know you have already asked me to be your valentine, so I decided I would make this quick and simple, as I have said yes to being your Valentine, but you have not been asked to be mine.
      <br><br>
      What does this entail, you might ask?
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Well, you are already my girlfriend, so I am hoping it would entail a kiss.</li>
        <li>We will get a dinner together, something we both want, and if we think it's romantic, we can call it romantic.</li>
        <li>Ultimately, I just want to spend quality time with you and enjoy the night.</li>
      </ul>
      So, here's your decision point, Debisha. What will it be?
