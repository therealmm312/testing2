    <p>
      Thank you for reading through this and participating. I love you regardless of your decision.
      <br><br>
      In this case, does this mean that I am no longer your Valentine? Or does it mean that I am your Valentine, but you are not mine? Please, do explain what I am to be expecting.
      <br><br>
      At this point, I have no way of knowing what you picked- so please do share with me in whichever way you would like. Thank you for dealing with this nonsense!
