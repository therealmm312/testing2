    <h2>Wonderful!</h2>

    <p>
      Thank you for agreeing to be my Valentine!
      <br><br>
      I hope you're satisfied with your decision- you now have this annoying, five-foot-three, always-underdressed masc as a date for this holiday rooted in capitalism.
      <br><br>
      A few notes:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>I love you so much and am glad to be able to call you my Valentine this year, again.</li>
        <li>If you have something in mind for dinner, you can pick- I don't mind at all.</li>
        <li>I am looking forward to spending Valentine's day with you this year in person and to be able to give you millions of kisses, hugs, and cuddles (if you'd accept them).</li>
      </ul>
      At this point, I have no way of knowing what you picked- so please do share with me in whichever way you would like. Thank you for agreeing to this for the fun and laughs!
    </p>

      <p>I hope you like how I brought this back this year- I am not sure of your response, but I hope you'll think it's kinda cute or fun.</p>    </span>
